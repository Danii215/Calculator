## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development tool
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Organizing and making the code sustanaible
-   [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is the second project I work with react + ts. The first one was a newsletter, also hosted on my github. I am really confident and happy with my new react + ts skills and wish to invest more in them in the future. I also liked the agility of Vite.

### Continued development

I wish to come back to this project again some other time and make more functions, play a little more with typescript :)
